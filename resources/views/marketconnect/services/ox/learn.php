As email needs grow, your customers are facing a decision: Remain on a dated (often free) email platform that no longer meets their needs OR move to a paid provider (Gmail/O365). OX App Suite helps fill the gap between these 2 choices.</p>\n\n            <h4>Will SMBs pay for Email?</h4>\n            <p>Simply put, \"YES!\" Email has become a crucial tool for practically every SMB. As such, they are expecting more than tiny mailboxes and poor spam/virus protection. Most SMBs are more than willing to pay for a quality, secure and reliable email service. Gmail and Office 365 are growing exponentially based on this principle - but now so can you!</p>\n\n            <h4>What messaging would be most effective for selling email to SMBs?</h4>\n            <p>Most SMBs are not super-technical businesses. They want a simple email address (@their-domain.com) they can rely on. Before you sell all the bells and whistles (of which App Suite has a ton!) be sure to cover their basic needs first: Uptime and reliability, followed closely by Premium Anti-Spam/Virus. Mailbox size, collaboration and Cloud File Storage are also increasing in importance these days.</p>\n\n            <h4>How much revenue/margin can I make on email?</h4>\n            <p>Of course that is completely up to you. Remember to add your company's special sauce to any App Suite Mailboxes you sell. Whether that be white glove migrations, 24x7 support and/or basic CRUD operations.</p>\n\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"activate\" role=\"tabpanel\">\n        ";
